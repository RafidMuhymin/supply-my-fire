          Supply My Fire was founded in [Year] with a simple mission: to bring
          warmth and style to Cardiff homes through expert fireplace
          installation and exceptional customer service.
        </p>

        <p>
          What started as [brief origin story - how the business began,
          founder's background in the industry] has grown into Cardiff's trusted
          fireplace and media wall specialists. Based on Whitchurch Road, we've
          spent over [X] years serving Cardiff homeowners, from Victorian
          terraces in Pontcanna to modern apartments in the city centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our journey hasn't been about rapid expansion or chasing trends.
          Instead, we've focused on building lasting relationships with Cardiff
          customers, staying at the forefront of fireplace technology, and
          maintaining the highest installation standards. This commitment earned
          us primary dealer status for Solution Fires, Vision Fires, Gazco, and
          Stovax - recognition that we're among Britain's leading fireplace
          retailers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We've watched media walls evolve from a niche request to Cardiff's
          most popular fireplace solution. We've helped hundreds of homeowners
          navigate the transition from open fires to efficient wood burning
          stoves. And we've guided countless families through choosing the
          perfect electric fire for homes without chimneys.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, Supply My Fire continues to be a family-run business that
          treats every Cardiff home like our own. Our team brings together
          decades of experience in HETAS and Gas Safe installation, bespoke
          design expertise, and a genuine passion for creating stunning focal
          points that transform living spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          From our Cardiff showroom to your living room, we're here to provide
          the expert advice, premium products, and professional installation
          that make your fireplace dreams a reality.
